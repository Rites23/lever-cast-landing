# Levercast Product Requirements Document

## Elevator Pitch
Levercast is a web application designed for busy entrepreneurs to effortlessly capture, format, and share their content ideas across multiple social media platforms. By simply entering raw text (and optionally uploading an image), users can leverage pre-defined templates powered by an LLM to generate polished, platform-specific content (starting with LinkedIn and Twitter). The application provides styled previews that mimic the final look on each platform and enables one-click publishing through OAuth integrations—saving time while amplifying marketing efforts.
